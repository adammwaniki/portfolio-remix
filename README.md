# Portfolio Remix

I have come to enjoy the versatility of musical terms so this is in essence a new rendition of my portfolio website that showcases more industry talent just like a remix ðŸŽµ

In the wise words of DJ Khaled, I present to you "another one".

# Tech Stack

This website is built using the GOTH stack:

- Go: an open-source, statically-typed and commpiled language.
- Templ: an HTML templating language for Go.
- HTMX: an open-source front-end JavaScript library that extends HTML to enable the use of AJAX directly in HTML
