# Portfolio Remix

==========================================================================================

This website serves as my updated portfolio, showcasing my latest projects and skills in modern web development, focusing on backend efficiency and accessible design.

I have come to enjoy the versatility of musical terms so this is in essence a new rendition of my portfolio website that showcases more industry talent i.e., my new and improved skills. Just like a remix ðŸŽµ

In the wise words of DJ Khaled, I present to you "another one".

## Tech Stack

This website is built using the GOTH stack:

- Go: an open-source, statically-typed and compiled language designed with systems programming in mind.
- Templ: an open-source HTML templating language for Go.
- HTMX: an open-source front-end JavaScript library that gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML

## Tenets of The Remix

I have implemented this redesign based on 3 tenets.
They are listed in order of importance:

- Design for disability.
- Systematic approach.
- Continuous improvement.

### Design For Disability

What does this mean?

In two words? "Inclusivity" and "Consideration".

Top priority is given to ensuring that people with sensory, cognitive, physical or other impairments do not experience unintended barriers when engaging with this project or its designs.

### Systematic Approach

What does this mean?

In two words? "Logical" and "Repeatable".

All interactions with this codebase and its user-facing aspects must follow a clear plan with defined steps.

This serves two main purposes:

- It ensures that any follow-ups I may need to do to review or update the code are handled efficiently and effectively.
- It builds client confidence, in that, users are able to find familiarity and stability in interactions that produce repeatable and consistent results.

### Continuous Improvement

What does this mean?

In two words? "Incremental" and "Adaptation"

This project exists as a remix to showcase how I have improved myself and adapted to the ever growing tech-scape.

## Closing Remarks

Feel free to explore the site and see these principles in action!

Every detail matters.
