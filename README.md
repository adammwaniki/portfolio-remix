## Portfolio Remix

I have come to enjoy the versatility of musical terms so this is in essence a new rendition of my portfolio website that showcases more industry talent just like a remix ðŸŽµ

In the wise words of DJ Khaled, I present to you "another one".

### Tech Stack

This website is built using the GOTH stack:

- Go: an open-source, statically-typed and compiled language designed with systems programming in mind.
- Templ: an open-source HTML templating language for Go.
- HTMX: an open-source front-end JavaScript library that gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML

#### Tenets of The Remix

I have implemented this redesign based on 3 tenets.
They are listed in order of importance:

- Design for disability.
- Systematic approach.
- Continuous improvement.

##### Design For Disability

What does this mean?

In two words? "Inclusivity" and "Consideration".

Top priority is given to ensuring that people with sensory, cognitive, physical or other impairments do not experience unintended barriers when engaging with this project or its designs.

###### Systematic Approach
